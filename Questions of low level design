        Deposit money
        Transfer money
Considerations:
        Implement classes like ATM, Account, Transaction, and User.
        Handle authentication via PIN.
        Track account balances and perform transactions.
7. Design a Simple Online Chat System
        Problem: Design an online chat system where users can:
        Send messages to each other
        Create chat rooms
        Display chat history
        Handle multiple users online
Considerations:
        Implement classes like User, Message, ChatRoom, and ChatServer.
        Design methods for sending and receiving messages.
        Handle user authentication and message history storage.
8. Design a Ticket Booking System
        Problem: Design a system that handles online ticket booking for events, flights, or movies:
        Users can book and cancel tickets
        Track seat availability
        Implement different pricing based on seat classes
Considerations:
        Define classes like Ticket, Event, User, Booking.
        Handle concurrency issues, such as double-booking of seats.
9. Design a Simple Social Media Platform
        Problem: Design a simple social media platform where users can:
        Post text/images
        Follow and unfollow other users
        Like and comment on posts
Considerations:
        Implement classes like User, Post, Comment, Follower.
        Manage relationships between users (e.g., followers).
        Track likes and comments for posts.
10. Design a Simple Order Management System
        Problem: Design a system to manage customer orders, where:
        Customers can place orders
        Orders can be tracked through stages (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered)
        Customers can cancel orders before shipping
Considerations:
        Define classes like Order, Customer, Product, and Payment.
        Track the status of orders and transitions between statuses.
