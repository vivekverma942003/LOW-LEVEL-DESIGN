WHAT IS OOP AND OOD?
OOPS  is used to solve the particular problem in a particular language but ood is used to solve  a problem using the design techniques and pattern to solve the the problem
OOD is used to create a solution which can be implemented in any language.

What is Solid principle?
SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY:- A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

Incorrect code :-class Book {
    private String title;
    private String author;

    public void borrowBook() {
        // Logic for borrowing a book
    }

    public void notifyMember() {
        // Logic for notifying a member
    }
}

Reason:- Imagine a Library system:
A Book class represents details about a book (e.g., title, author, ISBN).
Responsibilities like managing book borrowing or notifying members are separate from the Book class and should not be handled here.

Correct Code:- 
class Book {
    private String title;
    private String author;
    // Book-related properties and methods
}

class BorrowService {
    public void borrowBook(Book book) {
        // Logic for borrowing a book
    }
}

class NotificationService {
    public void notifyMember(String message) {
        // Logic for notifying a member
    }
}
